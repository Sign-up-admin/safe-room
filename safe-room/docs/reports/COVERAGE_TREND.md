## Trend Analysis

### Coverage Goals
- **Short-term (3 months)**: Achieve 65% line coverage, 45% branch coverage
- **Medium-term (6 months)**: Reach 75% line coverage, 60% branch coverage
- **Long-term (12 months)**: Maintain 80%+ coverage across all metrics

### Recommendations
1. **Focus on Controller layer**: Currently at ~7% coverage, target 30%
2. **Improve Service layer testing**: Current ~13% coverage, target 60%
3. **Add integration tests**: Use Testcontainers for database testing
4. **Regular monitoring**: Track coverage trends weekly

## Methodology

Coverage data is collected from:
- JaCoCo reports generated during CI/CD pipeline
- Automated test execution on each push/PR
- Historical data stored in `coverage-history/` directory
